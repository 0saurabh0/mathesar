==========

Mathesar is built using: 

* `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ for the data storage
* `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ for the backend
* `SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ to talk to the database
* `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ for the web application.

We have not decided on a frontend stack yet.
