Runs on a distribution of [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) called [`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## References

For basics of doc writing, see the [Writing your docs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) section of `mkdocs` user guide.

To preview as you write, use `mkdocs serve` (after having installed pip's development requirements and `cd`'ed to this directory). That will start a hot-reloading development server.

For some customization basics, see [Customization](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/customization/) section of `mkdocs-material`'s Getting started guide.

To learn about some of `mkdocs-material`'s features (annotations, code blocks, content tabs, etc.), see its [Reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/).
